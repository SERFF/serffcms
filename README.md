       * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
       *
       * <p>Implementation note: The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort
       * by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch. This algorithm
       * offers O(n log(n)) performance on many data sets that cause other
       * quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance, and is typically
       * faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
       *
       * @param a the array to be sorted
